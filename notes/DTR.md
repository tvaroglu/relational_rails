# DTR: Define the Relationship

### Project:  Relational Rails

### Group Member Names:  Antonio King, Taylor Varoglu, Alex Klick

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):  
  - Taylor:  Ensure priorities are understood and adhered to; have a well-built project vs pushing too hard to complete extensions (just for the sake of completing extensions), to avoid burnout and have a more positive group experience/dynamic; time to 'pre-retro' and ensure understanding with features, process, etc.
  - Antonio:  Goal to meet expectations, ideally attempt extensions, but only if full understanding on base expectations (refactoring, individualized practice).  Like to front-load project, to ensure enough time to review/refactor if needed (ideally two days prior to deadline, if within this window, fair to attempt extensions).  Tough to be "zoom-locked" for 8 hours, need to have some individual time to process (i.e. self-teaching other features built by other group members).
  - Alex:  

Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):  
  - Taylor:  Like to teach/answer questions; project management; light experience with MVC environments (Python Flask)
  - Antonio:  Very thorough, detail-oriented, and verbal/learn by doing (i.e. Pry in a technical implementation context).  Need individual time to reflect/understand, AND need time to ask questions and understand processes collectively (work to keep things big picture).  Would like to be 'led to water, but not shown how to drink' right away.
  - Alex:  

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:  Communicate obstacle, develop plan of action, agree on plan of action, execute plan of action, and follow up for understanding.
  - Taylor:  Technical experience, happy to "take the frogs"; project management experience and detail-orientation.
  - Antonio:  Project management experience, great at tracking requirements met not met.  Excellent communicator.
  - Alex:  

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):  No mornings!
  - Taylor:  Generally flexible, can work most days ~6 - 9:30 PM (only one day of PT per week, Wednesday afternoons 4:30 - 5:30)
  - Antonio:  NOT available Week of 7/5 (Wed/Thur/Fri) between 4:30 - 7:30, limited weekend availability (only available 1-4P, 7:30P+)
  - Alex:  Schedule fairly open

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):  
  - Taylor:  Communicate early and often (especially in the event of an issue/obstacle), utilize Slack for record keeping of resources
  - Antonio:  Ditto to Slack utilization & communication cadence
  - Alex:  Ditto to Slack utilization & communication cadence

Pomodoro Break Schedule:  
  - Taylor:  Work to improve upon this cadence - majorly struggled in Mod1 with this
  - Antonio:  POM master - 25 on / 4 off was effective in past projects; 4 hour max work block was also an effective strategy
  - Alex:  Also bad at this

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:  Similar to action plan steps for overcoming obstacles (problem statement, feelings behind problem statement, establish goal for resolution, and work to agree on solution(s))
  - Taylor:  Please be honest - 'check me' if my perfectionism is becoming an obstacle or I'm being too pushy
  - Antonio:  Feedback welcome at any point, always work to provide constructive (typically verbal) feedback
  - Alex:  

Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):  
  - Taylor:  Google Calendar, Trello (for agile project management)
  - Antonio:  Google Calendar, Jamboard (for whiteboarding and project tracking)
  - Alex:  

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):  TBD - need to understand project requirements better first
  - Taylor:  Your wish is my command
  - Antonio:  Like to be thorough and involved, but would like exposure/roughly balanced exposure to all parts of the project
  - Alex:  

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):  TBD - need to understand project requirements better first
  - Taylor:  
  - Antonio:  Rails fluency
  - Alex:  

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):  **Follow best practices (never merge your own PR without approval!)**
  - Taylor:  
  - Antonio:  
  - Alex:  

Additional Remote Considerations:  TBD
  - Taylor:  
  - Antonio:
